            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself.
          </div>

          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
          to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
          exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
          these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
          to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they
          only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

            locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and
            learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel
            by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
            traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the

            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the

            here?

            Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
            framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
            know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
            meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
            Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
            quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
            understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
            history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
            including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
            transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not
            only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
            Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            <h3>TEACHERS</h3>
            <p>
              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to
              find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring
              your students through for a visit.

            <h3>KIDS</h3>
            <p>
              Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
              on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn
              about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
              back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits
              are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure
              you come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars
              club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00
              where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of
              experts. During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs
              where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of
              discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find
              out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a
              message.
